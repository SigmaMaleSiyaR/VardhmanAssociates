  <p class='mb-3'>📘 Director Minutes &amp; Resolutions – Ensure Legal Compliance &amp; Strong Governance</p>
<p class='mb-3'>In every company, key decisions are made by its Board of Directors. But just making decisions isn&#x27;t enough—documenting those decisions legally and correctly is equally important. That&#x27;s where Director Minutes and Resolutions come into play.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>As a business owner or company director, you must comply with corporate governance norms laid down under the Companies Act, 2013. Whether it’s a board meeting or a shareholder meeting, maintaining accurate and timely minutes and resolutions is not just a formality—it’s a legal necessity that protects your business from future disputes, audits, or penalties.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Let us help you draft and maintain your board decisions in a professional and compliant manner, ensuring smooth corporate functioning.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>📝 What Are Director Minutes and Resolutions?</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Minutes are the official, written records of decisions taken during board meetings or general meetings.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Resolutions are formal decisions passed by the board or shareholders, either in meetings or via circulation.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>These documents serve as legal evidence of decisions made and ensure transparency and accountability in corporate governance.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>🔍 Levels &amp; Importance of Documentation</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Board Level: Minutes of Board Meetings (BM) are crucial for decision-making and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Shareholder Level: General Meeting Minutes (AGM/EGM) record decisions affecting shareholders&#x27; interests.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Committee Level: Minutes of committees (like Audit Committee, CSR Committee) as per requirement.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Proper documentation of these helps avoid:</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Legal disputes</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Regulatory penalties</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Non-compliance issues during audits or inspections</p>
<p class='mb-3'>⚖️ Legal Provisions under the Companies Act, 2013</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Section 118 – Deals with minutes of proceedings of general meetings, board meetings, and resolutions.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Section 179 – Covers the powers of the Board and authorisation of key decisions via resolutions.</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Rule 25 &amp; 26 of Companies (Management &amp; Administration) Rules, 2014 – Specify the manner of maintenance and signing of minutes.</p>
<h3 class='mt-4 fw-semibold'>Types of Resolutions</h3>
<p class='mb-3'>Depending on the nature of the decision, resolutions can be of the following types:</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Board Resolutions</p>

<p class='mb-3'>Resolutions by Circulation</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Passed without a physical meeting, sent to all directors for approval.</p>
