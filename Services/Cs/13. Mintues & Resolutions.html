  <p>📘 Director Minutes &amp; Resolutions – Ensure Legal Compliance &amp; Strong Governance</p>
<p>In every company, key decisions are made by its Board of Directors. But just making decisions isn&#x27;t enough—documenting those decisions legally and correctly is equally important. That&#x27;s where Director Minutes and Resolutions come into play.</p>
<p>As a business owner or company director, you must comply with corporate governance norms laid down under the Companies Act, 2013. Whether it’s a board meeting or a shareholder meeting, maintaining accurate and timely minutes and resolutions is not just a formality—it’s a legal necessity that protects your business from future disputes, audits, or penalties.</p>
<p>Let us help you draft and maintain your board decisions in a professional and compliant manner, ensuring smooth corporate functioning.</p>
<p>📝 What Are Director Minutes and Resolutions?</p>
<p>Minutes are the official, written records of decisions taken during board meetings or general meetings.</p>
<p>Resolutions are formal decisions passed by the board or shareholders, either in meetings or via circulation.</p>
<p>These documents serve as legal evidence of decisions made and ensure transparency and accountability in corporate governance.</p>
<p>🔍 Levels &amp; Importance of Documentation</p>
<p>Board Level: Minutes of Board Meetings (BM) are crucial for decision-making and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Shareholder Level: General Meeting Minutes (AGM/EGM) record decisions affecting shareholders&#x27; interests.</p>
<p>Committee Level: Minutes of committees (like Audit Committee, CSR Committee) as per requirement.</p>
<p>Proper documentation of these helps avoid:</p>
<p>Legal disputes</p>
<p>Regulatory penalties</p>
<p>Non-compliance issues during audits or inspections</p>
<p>⚖️ Legal Provisions under the Companies Act, 2013</p>
<p>Section 118 – Deals with minutes of proceedings of general meetings, board meetings, and resolutions.</p>
<p>Section 179 – Covers the powers of the Board and authorisation of key decisions via resolutions.</p>
<p>Rule 25 &amp; 26 of Companies (Management &amp; Administration) Rules, 2014 – Specify the manner of maintenance and signing of minutes.</p>
<p>🧾 Types of Resolutions</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the decision, resolutions can be of the following types:</p>
<p>Board Resolutions</p>
<p>Passed by the Board of Directors for routine or operational decisions, such as:</p>
<p>Appointment or resignation of directors</p>
<p>Opening bank accounts</p>
<p>Approval of financial statements</p>
<p>Allotment of shares</p>

<p>mergers, etc.).</p>
<p>Resolutions by Circulation</p>
<p>Passed without a physical meeting, sent to all directors for approval.</p>
<p>❗ Penalties for Non-Compliance</p>
<p>Failure to maintain or sign minutes properly may lead to:</p>
<p>Penalty up to ₹25,000 for the company</p>
<p>₹5,000 per officer in default (including directors/CS)</p>
<p>MCA may consider it as a case of mismanagement or suppression of records</p>
<p>Auditor or regulatory disqualification</p>
<p>⏳ Timelines &amp; Maintenance Requirements</p>
<p>🖋️ Format &amp; Key Contents of Minutes</p>
<p>Well-drafted minutes should contain:</p>
<p>Date, time, and venue of the meeting</p>
<p>Names of present members and quorum status</p>
<p>Agenda items discussed</p>
<p>Summary of deliberations</p>
<p>Exact resolution text passed</p>
