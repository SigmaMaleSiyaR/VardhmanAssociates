<p>As your trusted Company Secretary (CS) service provider, we assist you in making timely and accurate amendments to your company’s legal structure and statutory records, as per the Companies Act, 2013. Whether you&#x27;re updating your company name, registered office, directors, or capital structure — we help you ensure full compliance while keeping the Registrar of Companies (ROC) informed.</p>
<p>✅ What is a Company Amendment?</p>
<p>A company amendment refers to any official change made in the details or structure of a company that has been registered under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). These changes must be filed and approved by the Registrar of Companies (RoC) to remain legally valid.</p>
<p>🎯 Why Company Amendments Are Important?</p>
<p>From the client’s point of view:</p>
<p>✔️ Helps reflect the current structure and intentions of your company</p>
<p>✔️ Avoids legal penalties or non-compliance notices from MCA</p>
<p>✔️ Maintains transparency with stakeholders and government authorities</p>
<p>✔️ Ensures smooth operations during audits, funding, or expansion</p>
<p>📂 Types of Company Amendments We Handle</p>
<p>Here’s how we assist businesses with all necessary legal modifications:</p>
<p>📋 Mandatory ROC Forms for Company Amendments</p>
<p>Each amendment requires specific ROC forms. Clients often miss this technical part, so it’s good to list them clearly:</p>
<p>⚠️ Penalties for Non-Compliance</p>
<p>If amendments are not filed on time, the company and its officers may face:</p>
<p>₹100 per day per form for late filings</p>
<p>Notices or adjudication proceedings by ROC</p>
<p>Disqualification of directors in serious non-compliance cases</p>
<p>Make sure your clients understand: &quot;Timely filing saves legal trouble and maintains a clean compliance record.&quot;</p>
<p>🧾 Documents Required from Client</p>
<p>You should also list typical documents clients need to provide, like:</p>
<p>Board resolution or special resolution</p>
<p>ID/address proofs of directors or KMPs</p>
<p>Modified MOA/AOA (if applicable)</p>
<p>Proof of new registered office (like utility bill or lease agreement)</p>
<p>Digital Signatures (DSC) of directors</p>
<p>Consent letters or declarations</p>
<p>📈 When Should Clients File an Amendment?</p>
<p>Clients often don’t know when to update the ROC. Clarify that amendments should be filed whenever:</p>
<p>There is any structural/legal/business change</p>
<p>There is a change that reflects in company’s MOA/AOA</p>
<p>They hire or remove a director, auditor, or CFO/CEO</p>
<p>They relocate their office to a new address</p>
<p>They want to raise capital or issue shares</p>
