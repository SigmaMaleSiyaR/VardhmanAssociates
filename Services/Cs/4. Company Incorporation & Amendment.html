<h3 class='mt-4 fw-semibold'>What is a Company Amendment?</h3>
<p class='mb-3'>A company amendment refers to any official change made in the details or structure of a company that has been registered under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). These changes must be filed and approved by the Registrar of Companies (RoC) to remain legally valid.</p>
<h3 class='mt-4 fw-semibold'>Why Company Amendments Are Important?</h3>
<p class='mb-3'>From the client’s point of view:</p>

<p class='mb-3'>✔️ Maintains transparency with stakeholders and government authorities</p>
<p class='mb-3'>✔️ Ensures smooth operations during audits, funding, or expansion</p>
<p class='mb-3'>📂 Types of Company Amendments We Handle</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Here’s how we assist businesses with all necessary legal modifications:</p>
<p class='mb-3'>📋 Mandatory ROC Forms for Company Amendments</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Each amendment requires specific ROC forms. Clients often miss this technical part, so it’s good to list them clearly:</p>
<p class='mb-3'>⚠️ Penalties for Non-Compliance</p>
<p class='mb-3'>If amendments are not filed on time, the company and its officers may face:</p>
<p class='mb-3'>₹100 per day per form for late filings</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Notices or adjudication proceedings by ROC</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Disqualification of directors in serious non-compliance cases</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Make sure your clients understand: &quot;Timely filing saves legal trouble and maintains a clean compliance record.&quot;</p>
<h3 class='mt-4 fw-semibold'>Documents Required from Client</h3>
<p class='mb-3'>You should also list typical documents clients need to provide, like:</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Board resolution or special resolution</p>
<p class='mb-3'>ID/address proofs of directors or KMPs</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Modified MOA/AOA (if applicable)</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Proof of new registered office (like utility bill or lease agreement)</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Digital Signatures (DSC) of directors</p>
<p class='mb-3'>Consent letters or declarations</p>
<h3 class='mt-4 fw-semibold'>When Should Clients File an Amendment?</h3>
<p class='mb-3'>Clients often don’t know when to update the ROC. Clarify that amendments should be filed whenever:</p>
<p class='mb-3'>There is any structural/legal/business change</p>
<p class='mb-3'>There is a change that reflects in company’s MOA/AOA</p>
<p class='mb-3'>They hire or remove a director, auditor, or CFO/CEO</p>
<p class='mb-3'>They relocate their office to a new address</p>
