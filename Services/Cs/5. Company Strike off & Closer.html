<p>💼 What is Company Strike Off or Closure?</p>
<p>Company Strike Off refers to the process where a company voluntarily or compulsorily removes its name from the Register of Companies (ROC) under the Companies Act, 2013. Once struck off, the company legally ceases to exist and is considered closed.</p>
<p>📝 Modes of Company Closure:</p>
<p>1. Voluntary Strike Off (Section 248(2))</p>
<p>Applicable when a company:</p>
<p>Is not operational for 2 or more years.</p>
<p>Has no liabilities and has settled all dues.</p>
<p>Has obtained consent from shareholders/directors.</p>
<p>2. Strike Off by ROC (Section 248(1))</p>
<p>Initiated by the Registrar of Companies if:</p>
<p>The company fails to file annual returns/financials for two consecutive years.</p>
<p>The company is non-operational or inactive.</p>
<p>3. Winding Up (Liquidation Process)</p>
<p>If the company has pending liabilities or debts, formal winding up through NCLT or voluntary liquidation is followed under the Insolvency &amp; Bankruptcy Code (IBC).</p>
