          <h2>What is TDS Return Filing?</h2>
          <p>TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) is a method of collecting tax at the source of income generation. As a responsible taxpayer or deductor, you are required to deduct TDS while making certain payments like salary, rent, interest, commission, etc., and deposit it with the government.</p>
          <p>TDS Return is a quarterly statement submitted to the Income Tax Department, detailing all TDS deductions and payments.</p>
          <h2>Who Needs to File TDS Returns?</h2>
