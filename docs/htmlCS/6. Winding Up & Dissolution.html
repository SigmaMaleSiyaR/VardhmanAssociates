<p class="mb-3">What is Winding Up & Dissolution?</p>
<p class="mb-3">Winding up is the legal process of closing a company by liquidating its assets, settling liabilities, and distributing the remaining funds among stakeholders. Once all formalities are completed, the company is dissolved, meaning it ceases to exist in the eyes of law.</p>
<p class="mb-3">This process is crucial to avoid future liabilities, penalties, or legal complications with ROC, GST, or Income Tax departments.</p>
