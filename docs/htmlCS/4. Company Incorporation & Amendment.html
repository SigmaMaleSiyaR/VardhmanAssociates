<ul>
<li>What is a Company Amendment?</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-3">A company amendment refers to any official change made in the details or structure of a company that has been registered under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). These changes must be filed and approved by the Registrar of Companies (RoC) to remain legally valid.</p>
<p class="mb-3"> Why Company Amendments Are Important?</p>
<h3 class="mt-4">From the client’s point of view:</h3>
<p class="mb-3">✔️ Helps reflect the current structure and intentions of your company</p>
<p class="mb-3">✔️ Avoids legal penalties or non-compliance notices from MCA</p>
<p class="mb-3">✔️ Maintains transparency with stakeholders and government authorities</p>
<p class="mb-3">✔️ Ensures smooth operations during audits, funding, or expansion</p>
<p class="mb-3"> Types of Company Amendments We Handle</p>
<p class="mb-3">Here’s how we assist businesses with all necessary legal modifications:</p>
<p class="mb-3"> Mandatory ROC Forms for Company Amendments</p>
<p class="mb-3">Each amendment requires specific ROC forms. Clients often miss this technical part, so it’s good to list them clearly:</p>
<p class="mb-3">⚠️ Penalties for Non-Compliance</p>
<p class="mb-3">If amendments are not filed on time, the company and its officers may face:</p>
<p class="mb-3">₹100 per day per form for late filings</p>
<p class="mb-3">Notices or adjudication proceedings by ROC</p>
<p class="mb-3">Disqualification of directors in serious non-compliance cases</p>
<p class="mb-3">Make sure your clients understand: "Timely filing saves legal trouble and maintains a clean compliance record."</p>
<p class="mb-3"> Documents Required from Client</p>
<p class="mb-3">You should also list typical documents clients need to provide, like:</p>
<p class="mb-3">Board resolution or special resolution</p>
<p class="mb-3">ID/address proofs of directors or KMPs</p>
<p class="mb-3">Modified MOA/AOA (if applicable)</p>
<p class="mb-3">Proof of new registered office (like utility bill or lease agreement)</p>
<p class="mb-3">Digital Signatures (DSC) of directors</p>
<p class="mb-3">Consent letters or declarations</p>
<p class="mb-3"> When Should Clients File an Amendment?</p>
<p class="mb-3">Clients often don’t know when to update the ROC. Clarify that amendments should be filed whenever:</p>
<p class="mb-3">There is any structural/legal/business change</p>
<p class="mb-3">There is a change that reflects in company’s MOA/AOA</p>
<p class="mb-3">They hire or remove a director, auditor, or CFO/CEO</p>
<p class="mb-3">They relocate their office to a new address</p>
<p class="mb-3">They want to raise capital or issue shares</p>
