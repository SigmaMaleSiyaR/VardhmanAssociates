<p class="mb-3"> Director Minutes & Resolutions – Ensure Legal Compliance & Strong Governance</p>
<p class="mb-3">In every company, key decisions are made by its Board of Directors. But just making decisions isn't enough—documenting those decisions legally and correctly is equally important. That's where Director Minutes and Resolutions come into play.</p>
<p class="mb-3">As a business owner or company director, you must comply with corporate governance norms laid down under the Companies Act, 2013. Whether it’s a board meeting or a shareholder meeting, maintaining accurate and timely minutes and resolutions is not just a formality—it’s a legal necessity that protects your business from future disputes, audits, or penalties.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Let us help you draft and maintain your board decisions in a professional and compliant manner, ensuring smooth corporate functioning.</p>
<p class="mb-3"> What Are Director Minutes and Resolutions?</p>
<p class="mb-3">Minutes are the official, written records of decisions taken during board meetings or general meetings.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Resolutions are formal decisions passed by the board or shareholders, either in meetings or via circulation.</p>
<p class="mb-3">These documents serve as legal evidence of decisions made and ensure transparency and accountability in corporate governance.</p>
<p class="mb-3"> Levels & Importance of Documentation</p>
<p class="mb-3">Board Level: Minutes of Board Meetings (BM) are crucial for decision-making and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Shareholder Level: General Meeting Minutes (AGM/EGM) record decisions affecting shareholders' interests.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Committee Level: Minutes of committees (like Audit Committee, CSR Committee) as per requirement.</p>
