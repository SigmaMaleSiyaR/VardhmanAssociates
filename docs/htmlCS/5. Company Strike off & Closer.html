<p class="mb-3"> What is Company Strike Off or Closure?</p>
<p class="mb-3">Company Strike Off refers to the process where a company voluntarily or compulsorily removes its name from the Register of Companies (ROC) under the Companies Act, 2013. Once struck off, the company legally ceases to exist and is considered closed.</p>
