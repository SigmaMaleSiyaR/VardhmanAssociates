<p class="mb-3">Legal Notice– Your First Step Towards Justice</p>
<p class="mb-3">Have a dispute and want to take legal action? Start with a legal notice.
A legal notice is not just a piece of paper—it's a formal, strategic, and powerful communication tool. It signals your seriousness, puts the other party on alert, and often leads to resolution without the need for a full-fledged court case.</p>

<p class="mb-3">Why Legal Notice?</p>
<ul>
<li>To assert your legal rights without rushing to court</li>
<li>To inform the opposite party about a legal obligation or breach</li>
<li>To initiate a dialogue and possibly settle disputes amicably</li>
<li>It often becomes a crucial piece of evidence in litigation</li>
