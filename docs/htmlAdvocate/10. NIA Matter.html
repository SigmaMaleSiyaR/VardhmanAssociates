<p class="mb-3"> Understanding Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act</p>
<p class="mb-3">Section 138 deals with cheque dishonour due to insufficient funds or closure of account. It is a criminal offense, and the defaulter (drawer) can face imprisonment up to 2 years, fine up to double the cheque amount, or both.</p>
<h3 class="mt-4">To initiate a successful legal case under Section 138:</h3>
<p class="mb-3">The cheque must be issued for a legally enforceable debt or liability.</p>
<p class="mb-3">The cheque must be presented within its validity period (usually 3 months).</p>
<p class="mb-3">A written demand notice must be sent to the drawer within 30 days of dishonour.</p>
<p class="mb-3">The drawer must fail to pay within 15 days of receiving the notice.</p>
<p class="mb-3">A complaint must be filed within 1 month from the expiry of the 15-day period.</p>
<p class="mb-3"> Key Documents Required</p>
<h3 class="mt-4">Clients should be ready with the following:</h3>
<p class="mb-3">Original bounced cheque</p>
<p class="mb-3">Bank memo or return slip mentioning the reason for dishonour</p>
<p class="mb-3">Copy of the legal notice sent to the drawer</p>
<p class="mb-3">Postal/courier proof of notice delivery</p>
<p class="mb-3">Any agreement/invoice showing the liability</p>
<p class="mb-3">Identity & address proof of the complainant</p>
<ul>
<li>Jurisdiction of NIA Cases</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-3">As per amended law (2015 onwards), the complaint must be filed in the court having jurisdiction where the payee’s bank is located. This helps clients file cases conveniently without chasing defaulters in their cities.</p>
<p class="mb-3"> Client Tips for Stronger Cases</p>

<p class="mb-3">Ensure cheques are dated and filled correctly.</p>
